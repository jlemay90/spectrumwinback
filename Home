      Important: Going through me directly gets you special winback pricing and waived fees that <u>the website or 1-800 number can't match</u>. Online or phone orders usually include activation and install fees on the first bill, and <strong>do not include the 2-year price lock</strong> I can offer you in person.
      <br><br>
      <em>Even betterâ€”</em>you donâ€™t even need to have me back over to get started. No sensitive info is neededâ€”just your <strong>name, phone number, email, and birthdate</strong>. You can call or text me that anytime, and Iâ€™ll handle the rest from here.
